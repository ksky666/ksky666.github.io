# A2 Personal Website
This website is about my information to create a personal website for the course assignment. It contains my basic education background, skills, experience, contact information and two visualizations i created.

## Technologies that Used
I used visual studio code to type code (including html, css and js files).
GitHub Desktop and GitHub pages are used to generate and upload the codes.

## How to Navigate
You can find that the index.html is the homepage, and you can go to any pages with the navigation buttons on the top-right(about, skills, projects, contact, visulizations). For example, press the skills button, it will lead you to the detailed page of skills.
